Sample Excel File Structure for Attendance-Based Wage Calculation

To test the attendance-based wage calculation, create an Excel file with the following structure:

1. Create a new Excel file (.xlsx or .xls format)
2. Create a sheet with any name (e.g., "Sheet1", "Employees", etc.)
3. Leave the first 5 rows empty (they will be skipped)
4. Starting from row 6, add employee data with the following columns:

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Make sure there are no empty rows between your data rows
- All employee IDs must be unique
- Do not include any 'Total' or 'Sum' rows in your data
   - Column 1 (A): Card No (Employee ID) - any unique identifier for the employee
   - Column 2 (B): Name
   - Column 3 (C): Total (days attended) - e.g., 22, 24, 26, etc.
   - Column 4 (D): Basic Rate (daily salary) - e.g., 500, 600, etc.
   - Column 5 (E): Daily Allowance - e.g., 50, 100, etc. (can be empty, will be treated as 0)
   - Column 6 (F): NH/FH days - National Holiday/Festival Holiday days (can be empty, will be treated as 0)
   - Column 7 (G): OT days - Overtime days (can be empty, will be treated as 0)
   - Column 8 (H): Uniform Deduction - Amount to deduct for uniform (can be empty, will be treated as 0)
   - Column 9 (I): Professional Tax (PT) - Amount to deduct for professional tax (can be empty, will be treated as 0)
   - Column 10 (J): LWF40 - Boolean value (1 or 0) for LWF employee contribution (can be empty, will be treated as 0)
   - Column 11 (K): LWF60 - Boolean value (1 or 0) for LWF employer contribution (can be empty, will be treated as 0)

Example data for row 6:
A6: EMP001  (Any unique employee ID)
B6: John Doe
C6: 22  (Days attended this month)
D6: 500  (This is the daily rate, not the monthly salary)
E6: 50   (Daily allowance)
F6: 1    (1 National Holiday day)
G6: 2    (2 Overtime days)
H6: 100  (Uniform Deduction amount)
I6: 200  (Professional Tax amount)
J6: 1    (LWF40 enabled - will add 40rs employee contribution)
K6: 0    (LWF60 disabled - will not add employer contribution)

Example data for row 7:
A7: EMP002  (Any unique employee ID)
B7: Jane Smith
C7: 24  (Days attended this month)
D7: 600  (This is the daily rate, not the monthly salary)
E7:      (Empty - will be treated as 0)
F7:      (Empty - will be treated as 0)
G7:      (Empty - will be treated as 0)
H7:      (Empty - will be treated as 0)
I7: 150  (Professional Tax amount)
J7: 0    (LWF40 disabled)
K7: 1    (LWF60 enabled - will add 60rs employer contribution)

The system will calculate:

1. VDA Rate: Fixed at 135.32
2. PL: (Daily salary + VDA rate)/30 * 1.5
3. Bonus rate: (Daily salary + VDA rate)*8.33%
4. VDA: VDA Rate * Attendance
5. Bonus: Bonus rate * Attendance
6. PL daily rate: ((Monthly salary+VDA)*1.3)/26
7. PPE's cost: Attendance*3
8. Total-B: Monthly salary+VDA+Allowance+PL daily rate+Bonus+NH/FH Amt+OT wages+PPE's cost
9. ESI 0.75%: (((Attendance+NH/FH days)*(Daily Salary+VDA Rate+Daily Allowance+PL+3)+OT wages)*0.75%) [0.0075 as decimal]
10. PF 12%: ((Attendance+NH/FH days)*(Daily Salary+VDA Rate+Daily Allowance)*12%)
Total Deduction: ESI + PF + Uniform Deduction(if there) + PT(if there)
11. Bank Transfer: (round(Total-B - Total Deduction),0)
12. ESI 3.25%: (((Attendance+NH/FH days)*(Daily Salary+VDA Rate+Daily Allowance+PL+3)+OT wages)*3.25%) [0.0325 as decimal]
13. PF 13%: ((Attendance+NH/FH days)*(Daily Salary+VDA Rate+Daily Allowance)*13%)
14. Commission: 25*Attendance
15. CTC: Commission + PF 13% + ESI 3.25% + Total-B
